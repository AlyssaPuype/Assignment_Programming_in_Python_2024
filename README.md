# Study Tracker application

The application is used to track your studyprogress, by adding courses and studysessions. 
You can then edit and export your sessions into a csv or excel file.
You can also add and remove and view sessions and courses.

### How to install:

- clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/AlyssaPuype/Assignment_Programming_in_Python_2024
- navigate to the project folder Assignment_Programming_Python_2024
- install the requirements
- run main.py

### How to use:



### Notes for myself (delete or adapt after):

- Database manager = handles how the interaction w the database is done, so the actual queries
- Application manager = handles what is done (add, remove, edit, view,...)
- interaction flow: *User -> main.py -> application_manager -> database_manager -> database*
